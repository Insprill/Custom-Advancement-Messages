# Here you find all advancements.
# When the server starts, or when the plugin reload, this list is updated so it should always
# include every advancement on the server.
# All message support JSON in the the '/tellraw' command format. You can create JSON messages at https://minecraft.tools/en/tellraw.php.
# All messages also support HEX colors in the format '{#123456}'.
# All built in placeholders are the following:
#   [playerDisplayName] - Display name of player.
#   [playerName] - Name of player.
#   [prefix] - Players prefix (if vault is installed)
#   [suffix] - Players suffix (if vault is installed)
#   [adv] - Name of advancement.
# All messages also support PlaceholderAPI.
# If you want a message to be centered in the chatbot, put '<center>' at the beginning of the message.
# If you don't want a message, set it to 'none'.
# To use custom category's, firstly add one to the list. Lets say we added 'rare' like
# it is by default. Then, set the advancements message to 'custom.rare' and it will use that message!
